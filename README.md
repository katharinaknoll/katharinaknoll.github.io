## Jekyll

I used Jekyll for this site.
If you wanne build a site yourself, then go a head try [Jekyll](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) its easy and fun!!!

You can also watch (like me) [How to build a responsive website from start to finish](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KQZUkRjfwMmTq_f1fbxerI) 
from [DevTips YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KQZUkRjfwMmTq_f1fbxerI).
